# Sentiment Analysis for Amazon Review Dataset and its replications

## Introduction
Machine learning techniques have become increasingly popular and relevant to solve text and sentiment related problems in recent years. It has boosted performance on several tasks and significantly reduced the necessity for human efforts. For this project, we will focus on text classification, especially sentiment analysis, on several datasets. Since there are researches about sentiment analysis on Amazon Review dataset, we will first use the same methods on the same dataset, and then replicate the methods on datasets other than the Amazon Reviews dataset. By completing the project, we are trying to realize the following goals:
- Build four (tentative) text sentiment classifiers on Amazon Reviews dataset (BoW, Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText);
- Re-apply the above four classifiers on different datasets (e.g. [Drug Reveiw dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29);
- Compare different classifiers on same datasets; compare same classifier on different datasets

## Group Member & Peer Evaluation

rongl2: Word2Vec, Drug review data cleaning and EDA, GloVe on Drug review data

xdai12: GloVe, Bow and Word2Vec on Drug review data

zixingd2: BoW and/or TF-IDF (if possible) on Amazon and Drug review data

Comparision can be only a few words and some visualization

Expected timeline:

- By December 1 finish Amazon models
- By December 12 finish Drug review models
